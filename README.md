# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis Overview: 
In preperation for a phenomenon called the "Silver Tsunami", Pewlett-Hackard has asked for an overall look at employees set to retire 
in the upcoming years. Utilizing the average birth year we will begin to breakdown the total amount of potential retirees based on title,
and department. With a closer look at the number of suggested retires we can sufficently identify individuals who will fit into a mentor role 
to prepare exisiting employees to move up into the current roles on the retirees. 

## Analysis Results:
#### Retiring emaployees/titles
  1. Pulling a full list of retirement eligible employees gave us a large scale overview, further breaking down into additional parts.
  2. We then breakdown a second level to unique titles, removing duplicates to show a more accurate view.
  3. Moving to seperate the unique titles into a overall count of retirees based on title, we run a breakdown as shown below. 
  4. Working together these help reflect the overall number of retiring employees based on title.

#### Mentorship Eligible Employees

## Aanalysis Summary:
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  - 72,458 employees are within the retirement count, retiring over the span of 3 years, with a breakdown of about 24,150 employees
  retiring per year. Assuming those roles will be replaced we will need to see that amount of eligible employees ready for advancement while
  preparing for an influx of new hires.
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  - Based on the number of eligible senior staff that fall within the requirements for the mentorship program we can conclude that the silver
  tsunami heavily outweighs the 1,549 eligible mentors.
